## Project Challenge: CLI-Based Two-Player Vehicle Racing Game in PHP

**Project Brief**:  
Develop a CLI-based two-player racing game in PHP. The game begins with the players choosing a vehicle from a list provided in a `vehicles.json` file. Each vehicle has a maximum speed. The application will calculate the time taken by each vehicle to complete a given distance based on its speed, and then declare the winner.

**Core Features**:   
1. Load the list of available vehicles from a `vehicles.json` file.
2. Allow two players to select a vehicle each from this list.
3. Run a race using the selected vehicles.
4. Calculate the time taken by each vehicle to complete the race based on vehicle's speed.
5. Determine and display the winner.
6. Display the time taken by each vehicle to finish the race.

**Technical Requirements**:  
- Use Object-Oriented Programming principles in PHP.
- Utilize [PHP CLI tools](https://github.com/wp-cli/php-cli-tools) package for the Command-Line interface.
- Exhibit SOLID, KISS, YAGNI, and DRY principles in your code.
- Implement Composition over Inheritance design principle.
- Write clean and expressive code that reduces the dependency on comments.

**Post-Development Steps**:  
- Push your code to your GitHub account upon completion.
- Carefully commit changes with meaningful commit messages to highlight various development stages and changes made.

**Evaluation Metrics**:  
- Functional Completeness
- Adherence to Coding Principles
- Use of OOP
- Code Readability
- Commit History and Quality

**Time Frame**:  
Task completion within one week.
